# Questions before doing data visualization

The most important thing of doing data visualization is the goal of the project. Therefore, Swop and I sat down and discuss about what we wanted to gain from the datasets. After looking through both datasets, we agreed to do some data visualization and data analysis to answer some following questions:

1. What are the most 10 popular bikeshare stations?
2. Is anything special about trip durations between New York City and Boston?
3. With the policies of 30-minute limit checkout, what is the trip duration distribution of New York City, which is less than 30 minutes?
4. Are there any accidental checkouts in both cities? 
5. How many trips from Station A all the long way to Station A?
6. What is the gender ratio using bikeshare in both cities?
7. What is the trip duration by usertype distribution?
8. What is age distribution of people using bikeshare service in both cities?
9. What is the time/month that people use bikeshare most?
10. Which locations do people use bikeshare service most?

These are all of the questions we are thinking about. We then do some data visualization to answer all of these questions.
