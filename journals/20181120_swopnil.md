# Fundamental Pandas Functions (pt2)

__Renaming Columns__

We had to rename many of our columns and it turns out that renaing columns in Pandas is very simple. We can rename columns using a `pandas.rename()` function. A usage example of this for the dataframe `df` presented above would be:

```python

    df_renamed = df.rename(columns={'a':'b', 'b':'c', 'c':'a'})
```

__Merging Two Datasets__

We often had come across various datsets and had to compare one dataset against another like comparing stations with ride data. `pd.merge()` came much in hand. 

Using `pd.merge()` and specifying the axis and items to merge on allows you to quickly work with large datasets and relay them with one another. 

__Working with Datetime (timeseries data)__

If your dates are already formatted in a common syntax, `pd.to_datetime()` function allows us to easily extract components of the date and plot timeseries data. 

If the datetime is not in a very popular format we can first `import datetime` and use `datetime.datetime.strptime()` or `datetime.datetime.strptime()` to properly format the data. 

Working with timeseries data, if we every have to look at data by year, by day or by month, Pandas already contains functions to seperate those for you. You can use `pd.DateTimeIndex()` and extract compontents like `.dayofweek` or `.month` by passing them as properties. 

__Sampling a Dataset__

Pandas also allows us to quickly sample a dataset. The simplest way to sample a dataset using SRS is by using the `pd.sample()` method. Just pass some integer value `n` as a parameter and Pandas will return a dataset with that many rows. This was very helpful when out plots were taking a very long time.
