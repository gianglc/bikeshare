# Time Distribution of the Work

Looking at all the data and analysis, we realized that data science consists of many steps and data science is not just about analysis of data. A large part of data science work (sometimes even the majority) consists of collecting and feature scaling / manipulating the datasets. This was about 5% and 10% of the work respectively of the work that we did. 

The main analysis and visualization generation was also about another 23%. 

A large part of our effort was put into documenting our work by writing journals and also presenting our story in a legible and informative way taking our audience into consideration. This was probably the largest part of the work as we experimented with markdown, Sphinx, Hugo and different modules to manipulate the data. This was about 27% of the time. 

Almost all of the time when we encountered a problem, we also took into account learning new things. Whether it is proper repository management, writing in reStructured text and generating documentation websites out of Sphinx, learning new content took almost 35% of our times.
