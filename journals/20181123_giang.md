# Basis Analysis

After doing lots of visualization such as gender by usertype, trip duration distribution, accidental checkouts, Swop and I decided to take a look at what we gained from all of this stuff. 

Through the graphs of New York City and Bostion duration distribution without accidental checkouts, we observe that there are few people who are non-members rent the bikeshare with duration time less than 30 minutes while lots people in New York City rent the bikeshare with duration time less than 30 minutes (both members and non-members). However, the range of duration time between New York City and Boston varies a lot: New York City is from 0 to 70 (minutes) and Boston is from 0 - 9000 (minutes). It means that people often rent the bike day by day (short time) in New York City while people in Boston often rent the bike for a whole week (they regard bike as the main vehicle). Therefore, we can see in the graphs that the user type of poeple in Boston are annual member while that in New York varies between subscriber and customer a lot.

This is the first basis analysis we have from most of the graphs we have. We hope you enjoy it!
