# Drawback of Self Reported Data

Time Management was a big deal working in a long term project that required a lot of data visualization and analysis. 
One part of working with data science I learned was to expect that the data was going to be dirty and require us to clean it.

We came across multiple problems and drawbacks in using the data that we were using. 

Examples that come up immediately was that when we converted the 'Date Of Birth' column to age, some of the riders showed up as over 100 years old. One of the women registered was 119 years old. I realized that while almost all of the other data was collected by the organization, this data was self-reported therfore there was room for error.

Since we know for a fact that the age cannot be a 100% accurate, we would have to make the assumption that our data was mostly accurate and our visualizations using age were also mostly accurate. 

This made me think about organizations like Facebook, LinkedIn, Google or Twitter and how they would filter self-reported data as there must be milions of accounts that have incorrect information associated with them. Do they run an algorithm that finds trends in fake or unreliable data and filter them our or would there be a case of some 13 year old boys getting advertisements targetted at 80 year old grandmas?
