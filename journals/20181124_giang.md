# Heat map

Today, I try to grapph the heat map and bikeshare station map. I don't know why but I tried different ways to do the map, and it's still not working. I have already imported folium, and folium.plugins. However, when I tried to run the code, it's always showing that "MakerCluster module is not difined". I then found out that if the module of folium is not working, I have to import each module separately. For example with the MakerCluster module, I have imported this line first "from folium.plugins import MarkerCluster" and the MakerCluster will work.

I also have lots of problems with the heat map. When I run the code, it doesn't show any errors, but it doesn't appear as a HeatMap. Swop and I decided to ask Professor Kent Lee. After about 1 hour struggling with heat map, we found out that I made the mistakes with the orders of longtitude and lattitude, which makes the Heatmap not work at all. 

Moreover, the number of data is also limited in this graph. If I use all of the data, Jupyter Notebook cannot load the map. Therefore, Swop and I removed all the duplicates bikeshare stations and do the map again. At this time, all different kinds of map are working very well.
