# After Presentation

After the presentation, we believed that we did our best. This is the last entry in this journal. I thank Swop for being a great partner and our professor who has always been a great help. Even though Swop and I argued lots of time, we still found the way to deal with all of these problems. Thank you for putting up with me several times, helping me anytime I need you, and being my partner. 

Even though we felt proud of our performance, there are still lots of spaces to improve. We could have state our introduction clearer by giving the audience the lists of all the questions we want to find the answer. Also with the conclusion, it will be more clear if we focus on answering the question from the begining. 

After all, I have learned lots of new things from the projects! And we did a good, Swop!
