Selecting the Dataset: Motivations, Goals, Initial Ideas
--------------------------------------------------------

Author: `Swopnil N. Shrestha <https://github.com/swopnilnep>`__

To begin our project, we started by searching for the dataset we aimed
to investigate on. After some exploration on Kaggle and GitHub in search
for datasets, we came across
`BuzzFeedNews's <https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews>`__ repository to
multiple bikeshare companies across various Northeastern US cities.

We decided to build from the work that BuzzFeedNews had already done and
define the goals, motivations and initial ideas for projects that we
will be doing.

Motivation
----------

Bicycles ridership can tell a lot about the accessibility and lifestyle
of a city. We wanted to take this project as an opportunity to visualize
as well as tell a story through the lives of the bicyclists whose data
lives were portrayed in the data.

Goals
-----

Collecting data from the data vendors listed below and unifying the
features listed into a singular dataset for 4 US cities: **Boston**,
**New York City**, **Chicago** and Washington, D.C.
