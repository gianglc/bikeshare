# Setting up for Sphinx Website

We met in the library at 7 pm on that day to work on the website. Since Swop owns the repository, Swop was responsible foregenerating an SSH Key then create the website. I will take care of writing the content, description for our analysis. None of us has prior experience with Sphinx. So we both learn together. It took Swop several hour to get around and have everything ready to edit. We successfully generated a Sphinx website and what we need to do is to put up our analysis and notebook on the web.

It took me a while to write all the content into the website, and inserted the images of all the graphs. However, I had a problem when I tried to insert the map into the notebook. It's not working at all. So I asked Swop for help and he successfully fixed all my problems. 

However, because we are doing the same file at the same time, we cannot push the file to the repository due to the conflicts. We tried different ways to deal with conflicts and it's still not working. Therefore, we have to delete the directory in my computer and pull the directory again and push all my work to the remote.
